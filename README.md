#  Wayfair Case Study: Evaluating the "Ships in Time" Guarantee

This case study investigates the effectiveness of Wayfair's "Ships in Time" holiday campaign using A/B testing data from the 2016 Christmas season. The goal was to assess whether the delivery guarantee impacted customer behavior—specifically in terms of spending and order cancellations. Our analysis, powered by Tableau visualizations and cohort segmentation, helps quantify the campaign’s impact across visitor types and product categories.

 **Business Use Case**: Campaign performance analysis, revenue optimization, logistics management

## 1.  Business Question

**Did the “Ships in Time” guarantee increase customer spending and reduce cancellations across visitor segments, and how did this effect vary by product category?**

###  Why This Matters  
Wayfair’s holiday logistics are expensive and complex. Understanding if the guarantee increases average order value (AOV) and reduces cancellations helps justify its continuation or refinement. By examining visitor types and cancellation trends across categories, the company can better allocate marketing resources and tailor delivery strategies.

## 2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We analyzed cancellation trends by product category and visitor type.  
Key findings include:
- **Bedding** had the highest overall cancellation rate (~13%), followed by **Decorative Accents** (~8%).
- **Activated Customers** showed the highest cancellation rates across all product categories.
- This pattern raised questions about whether the delivery guarantee mitigates such behavior.

## 3.  Campaign Effectiveness Analysis

We focused on two primary metrics to assess the impact of the guarantee:

###  Metric 1: Average Order Value (AOV)
- **New Visitors**: +9% AOV with guarantee  
- **Returning Visitors**: +5.38% AOV with guarantee  
- **Acquired Members**: +7.12% AOV with guarantee  
- **Activated Customers**: Spent more without the guarantee  

 **Insight:** The guarantee effectively boosts spending for new and less-engaged users. Activated customers may already trust Wayfair and require fewer incentives.

###  Metric 2: Cancellation Rates
- **Group B (with guarantee)** had **~27%** of total cancellations  
- **Group A (no guarantee)** had **~73%**, showing that the guarantee generally reduced cancellation risk
- **Bedding** and **Rugs** remained high-risk categories for cancellation even with the guarantee

 **Insight:** While the guarantee helps overall, certain product types may need additional UX improvements (e.g., better descriptions, size previews).

## 4.  Recommendations

### Targeted Campaign Implementation  
Deploy the guarantee mainly to **new** and **returning customers** who benefit most.

### Product-Specific Enhancements  
Improve clarity in high-cancellation categories (Bedding, Rugs) through enhanced descriptions, images, and customer reviews.

### Loyalty & Personalization  
Offer exclusive perks to **activated customers**, who already show high AOV, rather than depending on guarantees.

### Cost-Benefit Evaluation  
Analyze the guarantee’s ROI—compare the uplift in revenue and reduction in cancellations against campaign execution costs.

## 5.  Conclusion

The “Ships in Time” guarantee is an effective campaign tool—especially for driving **higher AOV** among new customers and **reducing cancellations** across the board. However, its impact varies by visitor segment and product category. Tailoring strategies accordingly can maximize the benefit while controlling campaign cost.
